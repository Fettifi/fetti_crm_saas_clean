- [ ] Lead + Application status enums and dashboard widgets
  - Define Lead.status enum (NEW, CONTACTED, ENGAGED, DEAD, NOT_QUALIFIED) and make it required with default NEW.
  - Define Application.status enum (STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, SUBMITTED, INCOMPLETE, WITHDRAWN) and make it required with default STARTED.
  - Backfill existing leads and applications so no status fields are NULL.
  - Ensure each Application row links to a Contact via contactId and backfill existing records where possible.
  - Create "New Leads (last 7 days)" dashboard widget showing count and list of leads with status NEW created in the last 7 days.
  - Create "Apps In Progress" dashboard widget listing applications with status STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, or INCOMPLETE.
  - Create "Submitted Apps" dashboard widget listing applications with status SUBMITTED.
  - On first /apply step submission, create a new Application row (if none exists) and attach a Contact; return and reuse that Application on later steps.
